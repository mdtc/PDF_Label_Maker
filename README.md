# Label Maker

## Overview
The Label Maker is a Python-based application designed to generate styled PDF labels from an Excel file. It uses the ReportLab library for PDF generation and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use. The application supports adding logos, cursive titles, and other customizations to the labels.

## Features
- Generates 4x8 styled labels per page.
- Reads data from an Excel file, treating the second row as the header.
- Supports adding logos from a specified folder (`logos/`).
- Automatically opens the generated PDF after creation.
- Customizable fonts, sizes, and layout.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `tkinter`
  - `reportlab`
  - `Pillow`

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas pillow reportlab
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your Excel file in the same directory as the script or browse to it using the GUI.
2. Ensure the Excel file has the following structure:
   - The first row contains a special value (e.g., a title for the labels).
   - The second row contains the column headers.
   - Columns should include:
     - `#` (Product Code)
     - `Nombre` (Product Name)
     - `Lugar` (Size or Location)
3. Place logo images in the `logos/` folder. The filenames should match the product names in the Excel file (case-insensitive, spaces ignored).
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python label_maker.py
   ```
5. Use the GUI to select the Excel file and generate the labels.
6. The generated PDF will open automatically and be saved in the same directory as the script.

## Hardcoded Values
- **Excel File Structure**:
  - The first row is treated as a special value (e.g., title).
  - The second row is used as the header.
- **Label Layout**:
  - 4 columns and 8 rows per page.
  - Margins: 0.05 inches.
  - Internal label margin: 0.12 inches.
- **Fonts**:
  - Product Code: `Times-Bold`, size 12.
  - Product Name: `Helvetica`, size 14.
  - Cursive Title: `Times-Italic`, size 16.8 (calculated as 1.2x the name font size).
  - Size/Location: `Helvetica-Bold`, size 12.
- **Image Dimensions**:
  - Logo width: 1.2 inches.
  - Logo height: calculated based on aspect ratio.
  - Border image height: 0.15 inches.

## Folder Structure
- `label_maker.py`: Main script.
- `logos/`: Folder containing logo images.
- `Border.PNG`: Image used for top and bottom borders of labels.
- `build/`: Folder generated by PyInstaller (if used to create an executable).

## Notes
- If the `logos/` folder is missing, it will be created automatically.
- If a matching logo is not found, the title will be displayed in a cursive font instead.
- The application is designed for Windows but can be adapted for other operating systems.

## Troubleshooting
- **Error: Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all required libraries are installed.
- **Error: Missing Files**: Verify that the Excel file and `Border.PNG` are in the correct locations.
- **Error: Invalid Excel File**: Ensure the file follows the required structure.
